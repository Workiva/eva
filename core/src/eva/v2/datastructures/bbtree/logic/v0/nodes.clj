;; Important Legal Note.
;;
;; In our implementation of the btree structure, we don't exactly use pivot keys.
;; In the standard implementation, if a node has n children, it has n-1 pivots,
;; interposed. But in our implementation, we use "cap" keys. With n children, we
;; have n caps. These are arranged such that all caps to the "left" of a given
;; cap C correspond to children whose subdictionaries contain only keys strictly
;; less than C.
;;
;; The important legal bit: Before changing the organization scheme for the internal
;; keys (e.g., to more closely match the canonical B-tree as described in literature,
;; such as using standard 'pivots'), please contact Workiva's Legal/Patent Department.
